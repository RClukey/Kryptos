[KRYPTOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kryptos) is a currently unsolved cipher located in the CIA Headquaters in Langley, Virgina. The files in this repository show my processes of using different methods to crack this 

K1.py and K2.py show my process for learning how the Vigen√®re Cipher works.
K3.py shows my process of learning how the Transposition Cipher works.

K4.py is my process of learning how to automate different methods for cracking the unsolved section of the cipher.
